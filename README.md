# Journal X Simple

You will be building a simple version of [Journal X](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/journal-x-diary-with-lock/id1360257373) which only contains text entries. **This project usually take around 4 to 8 hours to complete based on your prior experience**.


## General Tips 

- **Less code is better code.**

- Write short precise comments.

- Follow good programming practices.

- Read the complete challenge before you start working.


## Designs 

You can find designs of the final app below. Screenshot on the left is the **Home Screen** and the screenshot on the right is the **Create New Entry Screen**. You can set any constraints while desinging the screens, but make sure final app looks similar to the designs provided.

## Requirements

- **Home Screen**
  - Contains all the entries and has a plus button to create a new entry. 
  - A user can tap on any entry to open it and can then edit it or delete it.
  
- **Create New Entry Screen**
  - Contains only the headline and text option with placeholder text and current date.
  - As the user is typing, make sure text does not get hidden behind the keypad
  - If a user taps on the return key while typing a headline, go to the text editing.
  - If a user taps on the back button and entry is not empty, it should save. Hence, only non empty entries should be saved. 
  - If a user taps on the delete button, show action sheet alert to confirm user action
  
- **Write at least 3 UI test cases using XCTest Framework**

- **Create another README file to explain your code base**

- **Optional**: Since it was previsouly requested from a lot of people, we have provided you assets and [designs](https://i.ibb.co/kS6JB7z/Screen-Shot-2020-04-03-at-10-19-12-PM.png) for dark mode also in the starter project, so if you want your app to support dark mode, you can do so. We recommend you to complete the above requirements first before working on this dark mode support. 

## Common Mistakes

- We are primarily looking for **good programming practices** while evaluating your submission, so don’t over engineer and implement functionality beyond requirements. 

- Your submission will be run on the latest version of Xcode, so make sure you start coding with the latest version to avoid unwanted crashes and bugs.

- Table view which contains all the entries has a fixed height, not dynamic height.

- Journal entry’s color should stay fixed once it is created. Don’t change the color of all journal entries everytime you reload the entries on Home Screen. Moreover, we have provided you hex color codes in the starter project.

- Change the bundle id before you start working on it

## Getting Started

We have provided you a starter project which has file directory set for MVC design pattern and some existing code to help you get a head-start. You can clone this repo to get started.
